##Input to STA algo is data filtered. 
##The algorithm should create the characteristic function so you can pick a threshold
##that allows you to get the arrival and end times of the quake
##Need to find a threshold that will work for every signal
##Make the threshold adaptable to different types of signals 
##Try out with different types of data
##Try different algorithms to see what gives best results based on criteria(tbd)
##to get the best and most accurate start and end times.
