Brainstorm

Goal: Identify seismic events using algorithms or manually sifting through the data


Algorithms to look into

- STA/LTA
- machine learning techniques
- high-pass filters
- Fourier spectrum analysis


Considerations:
- Presence of missing data and glitches
- Accuracy is important
- low signal-to-noise ratio
- different or adaptable algorithms of the dataset
- display the seismic waves

Info on Seismographs
- Primary (P) waves (higher frequency travelling in the same direction followed by the energy)
- Secondary (S) waves (higher amplitudes travelling in the perpendicular direction the energy)
- time interval dt between P and S waves can be used to get the distance to the origin of the earthquake.
- Magnitude derived from the amplitude and distance
- Surface waves (Rayleigh waves) are caused by P and S waves hitting the earth's surface
- Surface waves attenuate more slowly than P and S waves -- > largest waves on long period seismograms

typical for an earthquake signal to have very strong signal in a short time at arrival
